If we choose the wrong kind of visualisation we could give a misleading message, or even completely fail to communicate it altogether.\n",

    " In this session we will consider which visualisation is best applied in different circumstances, and create visualisations using the libraries Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly. After we get an understanding of how these libraries work, we will display some geographic data on a map, choosing an appropriate method and projection\n"

    "The way in which we display our data is incredibly important to convey information, and the kind of visualisation we chose depends primarily on two factors - what kind of data we have, and what information we are trying to convey.\n",
    "\n",
    " For example, if we want to demonstrate the differences in height between children at 4 years old, and 5 years old, we could plot each individual point on a graph like this. [points instead of a histogram]. We can kind of see the difference between the two groups, but it's really difficult to tell. Even though they are seperated on the bottom axis, the two groups still aren't very distinct. So let's make them different colours[coloured points instead of a histogram]. This is better, but still not very easy to see. That's because this kind of scatter plot is inappropriate to compare between two categories, when there is only a single measurement for each individual. What works much better here, is the use of a histogram [histogram]. Now we can see the average difference between these two groups, and this is great, because the samples of both of these normally distributed.\n",
    " \n",
    "   So histograms are great for working with height, and like we said, the visualisation needs to be appropriate for the data. But what if we consider a new dataset, that seems like it's quite similar to the last one. Let's imagine we are applying for a new job in two different companies. Everything about both companies seems to be the same, and we've been offered both positions, the only difference is, there appears to be different payscales, but for some reason, we won't find out how much we will be paid until after we accept an offer.... We have however, got a sneak peak at the overall pay records in the companies, so we can make our decision based on what we might expect to get. So, like before, let's see a histogram of the pay. [histogram of pay]. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Wow! We're clearly going to choose company A because it has the highest average pay! But, because histograms only provide us with the average, we might miss something important! If we go back to plotting all the points, we can see something funny here.... company A has the highest average, but most employees get paid much less than the CEO! As we're not going to be CEO of this company, we can assume that we will fall in the lesser paid group, meaning that we should have chosen Company B! But, like we said before plotting single points isn't really appropriate when working with single measurements of single variables. A great option for this, is boxplots [boxplots]. Here, we get an insight into the distributions of our data - the line in the centre of these boxes is the median, rather than the mean that we seen with the histograms. But we also now have these boxes too. The box above the median line represents the 25% of the datapoints, otherwise known as a quartile, that are above the median. This line above that box, is known as a whisker, and represents the very highest 25%. The same applies to the bottom two quartiles, with 25% of the data falling in this part of the box, and the very lowest paid 25% being represented by this whisker. So you can see now, that company A is very skewed, with almost all the people being paid below the mean. Company B, however, has a much more even distribution, meaning that they're a much better bet!\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This is all fine if we're comparing a single measurement between different groups. But, what if we want compare data that has structure, like time-series data? For example, if instead of comparing the heights of children at 2 different ages, we want to see how their heights change over time. In that case, we can use a scatter plot,[scatter with all children] where we plot single points on a graph, with the x axis representing an ordered variable, like age. Now we can see that the children generally get taller as they get older. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   If we were to look at the height of just one of those children [scatter with one child], each of the datapoints has a direct relation to the next, and we can therefore draw a line between them, [line with one child] to create a line graph. But be careful when using line graphs; when we join datapoints, we have to make sure that it makes sense; drawing a line between unrelated pieces of information would just be confusing. If we would like to, we can stack linegraphs on top of each other, to show the growth of multiple children.[line with two children][then][line with three children] Just be aware of adding too many, and making it harder to interpret. [line with all children]\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   These are just some of the most fundamental visualisations, and we could easily create a whole module to try to cover the vast array of different methods available to us. But a good starting point is knowing when to use histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and line graphs.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",

Projections are interesting, because when we are trying to visualise a 3D sphere like the earth, we project it as a rectangle, and this means that there will always be distortion of sizes.

As a byte can only represent 256 values, 255 is the highest value we can have. Hence, all red, all green, and all blue, gives us the colour white, at least in a computer.
